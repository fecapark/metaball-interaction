## Info

Use WebGL([PIXI.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs)) for high performance,

In computer graphics, [metaballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs) can be implemented using a opacity-[thresholding](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thresholding_(image_processing)>) method with [Gaussian Blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur).

But PIXI.js doesn't have threshold filter, so I made it.
